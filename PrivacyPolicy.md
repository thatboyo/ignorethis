Remains in a voice channel for extended periods.

It does not record audio or collect voice data.

Managing social credit scores.

Assigning roles based on score thresholds.

Reasonable measures are taken to protect data from unauthorized access.

No sensitive personal information (real names, emails, etc.) is collected.
